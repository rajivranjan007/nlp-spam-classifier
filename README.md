## üîç Project Overview

This project uses text classification techniques to detect spam in email/SMS content. It involves:
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Classification using a **Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / Random Forest** model
- Deployment via **Streamlit**
